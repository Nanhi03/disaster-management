        <h1>Overview & Geography</h1><br>
        <h2>Overview of Punjab's Geographical and Climatic Conditions</h2>
        <p>
            Punjab, located in northern India, is characterized by diverse geographical features that significantly
            impact its vulnerability to disasters.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Rivers:</strong> The region is crisscrossed by several major rivers, including the Beas, Sutlej, and
            Ravi. While these rivers contribute to the fertility of the land, they also pose a risk of flooding during
            the monsoon season.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Topography:</strong> Punjab's topography is predominantly flat, making it susceptible to
            waterlogging in low-lying areas. The lack of natural barriers exacerbates the impact of floods and other
            water-related disasters.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Climate Patterns:</strong> Punjab experiences a diverse climate, with hot summers and cold winters.
            The monsoon season brings heavy rainfall, contributing to the risk of floods. Additionally, the region is
            prone to occasional droughts, affecting agriculture and water resources.

        <h2>Importance of Disaster Management</h2>
        <p>
            Punjab, with its diverse geographical and climatic conditions, faces various natural and man-made disasters
            that can have severe consequences on the well-being of its residents and the overall infrastructure.
            Implementing effective disaster management strategies is crucial for several reasons:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> Punjab is susceptible to disasters such as floods, droughts, earthquakes,
            and industrial accidents. Disaster management helps identify and assess these risks, allowing for the
            development of proactive measures to mitigate their impact and protect lives and property.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Human Safety:</strong> The safety of the population is of utmost importance. Proper disaster
            management ensures swift and organized responses during emergencies, including evacuation plans, emergency
            shelters, and first aid services, reducing the risk of injuries and casualties.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Infrastructure Protection:</strong> Disasters can cause significant damage to critical
            infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and utilities. Disaster management strategies focus on safeguarding
            and strengthening these structures to minimize disruption and expedite recovery efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Economic Stability:</strong> Unmitigated disasters can have a severe economic impact, disrupting
            agricultural activities, businesses, and livelihoods. By implementing effective disaster management, Punjab
            can enhance its resilience, ensuring a quicker recovery and sustainable economic stability.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Environmental Conservation:</strong> Some disasters, such as industrial accidents, can lead to
            environmental degradation. Disaster management emphasizes eco-friendly practices and pollution control
            measures to minimize long-term environmental consequences.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Community Preparedness:</strong> Educating and training communities on disaster preparedness and
            response is a key aspect of disaster management. Building awareness and fostering a culture of preparedness
            empower individuals to take active roles in their safety and the well-being of their communities.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the absence of effective disaster management, Punjab could face widespread devastation, loss of life, and
            prolonged recovery periods. It is essential for the region to invest in robust disaster management
            strategies to build resilience and ensure the safety and security of its residents.

        <h1>Overview of Various Disasters in Punjab</h1><br>
        <h2>Floods</h2>

        <p>
            Punjab, a region historically known as the "Land of Five Rivers," has a long history of devastating floods.
            These floods have caused significant loss of life, property damage, and displacement, impacting the region's
            social, economic, and agricultural sectors. Here's a list of some notable historical floods in Punjab:
        </p>

        <div class="disaster-overview">

            <div class="disaster-type">
                <h5>1955 Floods:</h5>
                <p>
                    In 1955, Punjab experienced severe floods due to heavy rainfall and the release of excess water from
                    dams. The Sutlej and Ravi rivers breached their banks, submerging villages and agricultural lands.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="disaster-type">
                <h5>1993 Floods:</h5>
                <p>
                    Just five years after the 1988 floods, Punjab was struck again by devastating floods. Heavy monsoon
                    rains triggered the overflowing of rivers, inundating vast areas and causing significant damage to
                    infrastructure, crops, and livestock.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="disaster-type">
                <h5>2013 Floods:</h5>
                <p>
                    In 2013, Punjab once again faced severe flooding due to heavy monsoon rains. The Beas and Sutlej
                    rivers overflowed, affecting over 1,600 villages and causing widespread damage to crops and
                    infrastructure.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="disaster-type">
                <h5>2019 Floods:</h5>
                <p>
                    The 2019 floods caused significant damage in Punjab, particularly in the Malwa region. Heavy
                    rainfall led to the overflowing of the Ghaggar-Hakra river system, inundating villages and
                    agricultural lands.
                </p>
            </div>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>A disaster prevention and recovery plan is not a substitute for the good sense, sound management, and
            creativity that are required when responding to a disaster or crisis. The format and elements of a disaster
            plan vary widely from the comprehensive disaster plan of a multi-national corporation with complex legal,
            insurance, information, and security needs to the brief disaster prevention and recovery guide for small
            organizations or departments.
            Start your plan by following a disaster prevention and recovery guide and obtain needed training. Here are
            basic rules to follow:</p>

                        emergency preparedness. Each department should be aware of its specific roles and
                        responsibilities outlined in the plan.</div>

        <p>While no disaster plan assures successful resumption of business operations, such a plan greatly tips the
            odds in favor of survival or recovery. Prior identification and protection of vital records, a clear plan
            for reconstruction and salvaging these records, and prior thought about the necessary steps to take after a
            disaster allows a department to enter a crisis situation with confidence and direction. </p>
